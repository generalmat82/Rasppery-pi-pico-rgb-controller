This section of the repositary is for the hardware nececity of the project.

# Project nececity:
When I started the project I wanted to be able to controll the 2 RGB strips on my desk through WIFI since the remotes were pretty broken and why not?
The project needed the following:
* Be able to run both RGB strips separately.
* Be able to controll them with my computer.
* Be fully made by me(except the components and things I couldnt do myself)


# Hardware components:
For the project I used:
* 3 [IRLB8721PBF-ND](https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/infineon-technologies/IRLB8721PBF/2127670) per strips
* 1 [RASPBERRY PI PICO W RP2040](https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/raspberry-pi/SC0918/16608263)
* 1 [S7002-ND](https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/sullins-connector-solutions/PPTC041LFBN-RC/810144) per strips
* I also had a laptop running Ubuntu for the front end and backend that was communicating with the RPI Pico W.
