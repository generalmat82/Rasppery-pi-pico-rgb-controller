This section of the repositary is for the hardware nececity of the project.

#Project nececity:
When I started the project I wanted to be able to controll the 2 RGB strips on my desk through WIFI since the remotes were pretty broken and why not?
The project needed the following:
* Be able to run both RGB strips separately.
* Be able to controll them with my computer.
* Be fully made by me(except the components and things I couldnt do myself)


# Hardware components:
For the project I used
