The front end is ran by a npm package named [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).
This runs the webpage to easily communicate with the backend.
# How to start it:
In my case I ran both frontend and backend on a old laptop runing ubuntu. 
First you need to have nodeJs installed.
Then you can install http-server by running `npm i http-server` in the terminal.
