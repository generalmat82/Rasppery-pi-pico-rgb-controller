This Project was a project I started when I was in need of a RGB controller for rgb strips I had on my desk. I thus decided to make it a lot more expensive by doing it myself!
I wanted to be able to controll the RGB strips from my computer, I also wanted it to be mostly made by me.

I separated the project into 3 parts:
* Frontend
  * This would be the section with a webpage to controll the controller. 
* Backend
  * This would be the place where all the current values was being saved; With a bit of moddifications we could get rid of this section entirely.
* Controller
  * Finally this is the place that actually controlls the rgb strips.
